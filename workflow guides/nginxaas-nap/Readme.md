## Introduction
This demo guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough for configuring  It utilizes Terraform scripts to automate the deployment process, making it more efficient and streamlined. For further details, please consult the official [documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/integrations/). Also, you can find more insights in the DevCentral article [F5 NGINX Automation Examples [Part 1-Deploy F5 NGINX Ingress Controller with App ProtectV5]](https://community.f5.com/kb/technicalarticles/f5-nginx-automation-examples-part-1-deploy-f5-nginx-ingress-controller-with-app-/340500).

## Architecture Diagram
![System Architecture](assets/AWS.jpeg)

4. Enter the secret name exactly as shown above
5. Paste the secret value
6. Click **Add secret**

### How to Add Variables

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository
2. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **Variables** tab
4. Click **New repository variable**
5. Enter the variable name exactly as shown above
6. Paste the variable value

| `NGINX_Repo_CRT`        | Secret  | NGINX Certificate                                                                                       | 
| `NGINX_Repo_KEY`        | Secret  | Private key for securing HTTPS and verifying SSL/TLS certificates                                       |
| `TF_VAR_PROJECT_PREFIX`     | Variable | Your project identifier name in lowercase letters only - this will be applied as a prefix to all assets | 
| `TF_VAR_AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`  | Variable  | Unique S3 bucket name                                                                                   | 
| `TF_VAR_AWS_REGION`        | Variable  | AWS region. Note: The region should support atleast two availability zones                              |
| `TF_VAR_RESOURCE_OWNER`     | Variable | Resource owner name                                                                                     |

## Workflow Runs

### STEP 1: Workflow Branches

Check out a branch with the branch name as suggested below for the workflow you wish to run using the following naming convention.

**DEPLOY**
```sh
git checkout -b apply-nic-napv5
```
  | Workflow        | Branch Name     |
  |-----------------|-----------------|
  | apply-nic-napv5 | apply-nic-napv5 |

**DESTROY**

  | Workflow          | Branch Name       |
  |-------------------|-------------------|
  | destroy-nic-napv5 | destroy-nic-napv5 |
### STEP 2: Policy 

The repository includes a default policy file named `policy.json`, which can be found in the `AWS/policy` directory.

```hcl
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "policy_name",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },
        "applicationLanguage": "utf-8",
        "enforcementMode": "blocking"
    }
}
```
 
Users have the option to utilize the existing policy or, if preferred, create a custom policy. To do this, place the custom policy in the designated policy folder and name it `policy.json` or any name you choose. If you decide to use a different name, update the corresponding name in the [`apply-nic-napv5.yml`](https://github.com/f5devcentral/nginx_automation_examples/blob/main/.github/workflows/apply-nic-napv5.yml) and  [`destroy-nic-napv5.yml`](https://github.com/f5devcentral/nginx_automation_examples/blob/main/.github/workflows/destroy-nic-napv5.yml) workflow files accordingly.

  In the workflow files, locate the terraform_policy job and rename `policy.json` to your preferred name if you've decided to change it.

### STEP 3: Deploy Workflow
 
Commit the changes and push your apply branch to the forked repo
```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "AWS Deploy"
git push origin apply-nic-napv5
```

### STEP 4: Monitor the workflow

Back in GitHub, navigate to the Actions tab of your forked repo and monitor your build. Once the pipeline completes, verify your assets were deployed in GCP

  ![deploy](assets/deploy.png)


### STEP 5: Validation  

Users can now access the application through the NGINX Ingress Controller Load Balancer, which enhances security for the backend application by implementing the configured Web Application Firewall (WAF) policies. This setup not only improves accessibility but also ensures that the application is protected from various web threats.

  ![IP](assets/ext_ip.png)

* Access the application:

  ![arcadia](assets/arcadia.png)

* Verify that the cross-site scripting is detected and blocked by NGINX App Protect.

### STEP 6: Destroy Workflow  

If you want to destroy the entire setup, checkout a branch with name **`destroy-nic-napv5`** and push your destroy branch to the forked repo.
```sh
git checkout -b destroy-nic-napv5
git commit --allow-empty -m "AWS Destroy"
git push origin destroy-nic-napv5
```

Back in GitHub, navigate to the Actions tab of your forked repo and monitor your workflow
  
Once the pipeline is completed, verify that your assets were destroyed
